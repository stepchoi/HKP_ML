Recreation Instruction

This instruction will walk through all steps needed to create the same datasets as used in our model.

1. Start with TABLE raw in PostgreSQL. This table is directly downloaded from WRDS using website query to csv and uploaded.


PostgreSQL TABLE      (to be uploaded)             niq              (to be uploaded)
(or csv files)              raw                     |                  macro_raw
                             |                      |                      |
# Run Code           PrepareDatabase.py             |                      |
                             |                      |                      |
PostgreSQL TABLE          raw_main                  |                      |
                             |                      |                      |
# Run Code           ConvertDatabase.py    DependentVariable.py      Macro_process.py
                             |                      |                      |
PostgreSQL TABLE            main                   niq                 macro_main
                              \                     |                      /
                                --------------------|----------------------
                                                LoadData.py
                                    (import & run everytime before PCA/AE)      # if need to run on SQL, remember to change to load_date(sql_version = True)
                                                    |
                                    ----------------|----------------
                                  /                 |                 \
                               PCA.py       LightGBM_Hyperopt.py      ....
                                               (Current Focus)

2. LoadData.py will be imported into different .py code, and return x, y needed.
